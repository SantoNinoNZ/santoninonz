The Sto.Nino sometimes played innocent pranks. One day, a fish vendor, passing by the Sto.Nino Basilica, accousted a small boy who wanted to buy a bunch of fish. He said that the Sacristan Mayor would pay for the fish that afternoon.

The fish vendor later returned to get the payment but the Sacristan Mayor disclaimed buying any fish. When the fish vendor insisted that one of his young altar boys got the fish, the Sacristan Mayor smiled and readily paid the fish vendor. He hurriedly went to where the Sto.Nino was housed and he saw a bunch of fish hanging beside the altar.

Inviting young boys and girls including those who were trained last year and performed during the jan 2012 fiesta, to join the Sinulog Drumline Group.  Fresh training will be given provided by a new trainor, Alexis Gerinea.  He used to be a marching band instructor for one of the universities in Cebu and he also trained at the Sto Nino Basilica.  Schenjie Ubod  who is likewise an instructor from Cebu will train Bugle and Lyre.  (We are in the process of buying those so we need more young people to join this group.)

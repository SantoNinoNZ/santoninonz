As part of our fitness programme for 2016, we will start dance workshops for the Sinulog dance group.

We need at least 25 participants (no age limit or gender preference) who will be committed to weekly dance workshops. Dance practices will be every Tuesday night at 7:00 pm. Feel free to invite family and friends to this fun activity for a healthier lifestyle.

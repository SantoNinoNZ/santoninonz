**Some thoughts on Liturgical Dance:**

**Liturgical Dance** is a Christian expression of prayer or worship, through body movement which can be accompanied by many different types of music with the dancers responding with an appropriate dance which flows out of the music and enhances the prayer or worship experience.  The dance may be spontaneous, or have been choreographed.  (Excerpts from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia).

**Dance as a Language of Faith, wrote:**

**“**Dancing before God was an experience of both revelation and response; an intense and vital expression of love, praise, thanksgiving, mystery, fear and even anger. Scripture records Miriam’s dance of thanksgiving before the Israelites as they were delivered at the Sea of Reeds (Exod. 15:20-21) and David’s dance of ecstasy before the ark (II Sam. 6:14) The Psalms, written to accompany acts of worship in the temple, offer many examples of dance and liturgical movement. To dance was to praise God with the fullest expression of joy. To kneel and bow down was to show reverence and obedience. In _The Liturgy as Dance_ Carolyn Deitering writes, “Processions, prostrations, encircling of the altar or Torah, bowing, lifting the hands in prayer, swaying and dancing were all embraced as human actions which assisted the community’s prayer to Yahweh.”

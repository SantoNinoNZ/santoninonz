We are truly grateful, blessed and honoured, the privilege to be part of the Sinulog Festival Celebration 2017. With the blessings of our Holy Infant Jesus, Senyor Sto. Niño may we continue to share the blessings to all our devotees within and around the world. We will continue to inspire the tradition, mission and vision in good faith with the guidance of His loving grace and mercy. May this year and the years ahead, we will continuously experience the blessings of love, peace, good health, happiness, unity and the power of healing to each and every one of us. God bless us all.

Viva Pit Senyor Sto. Niño. Alan and Bebie Cal

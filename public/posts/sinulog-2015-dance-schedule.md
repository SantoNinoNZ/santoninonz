Many have witnessed to the immense blessings they have received by offering their time, talent and gifts to Sto Nino thru their dance offering and most of all their prayers. God’s grace abounds in our prayers and praises which, in this instance, we offer thru our dances.

Let us come together once again to give glory to God thru our devotions to Senyor Santo Nino.

Most of all, let us pray for one another and for all our upcoming activities.

**Pit Senyor!!!!!!!!!!**

Love and prayers

Tito Oscar and Tita Miriam

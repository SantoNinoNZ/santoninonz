**The Holy Father, Pope Francis, initiated the worldwide prayer of the Holy Rosary.**

**The NZ Filipino Devotees of Senor Santo Nino invite all devotees to continue to pray the Holy Rosary everyday at anytime of the day.**

May we also invite you to pray the Perpetual Novena to Senor Santo Nino.

Pray the Holy Rosary Daily (an excerpt)

**“**The Most Holy Virgin in these last times in

which we live has given a new efficacy to the

recitation of the Rosary to such an extent that

there is no problem, no matter how difficult it

is, whether temporal or above all spiritual, in

the personal life of each one of us, of our

families… that cannot be solved by the Rosary. 

There is no problem, I tell you, no matter how

difficult it is, that we cannot resolve by the

prayer of the Holy Rosary.” – Sister Lucia of

Fatima.

**PRAYER:**

**O Mary Immaculate, who revealed thyself at**

Fatima to Lucia, Francisco and Jacinta as “Our

Lady of the Rosary,” renew in my heart the joy

of true devoiton to Thee.

May the contemplation of the mysteries

contained in the Life, Passion and Glory of thy

Divine Son be for me strength in weaakness,

assurance in doubt, courage in suffering, and

gratitude.

O Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, in these

times of trial and confusion, obtain for me, by

the Precious Blood of thy Son, pardon for my

sins,. the salvation of my soul, and the 

necessary means to secure it.  Protect my

family from the dangers that surround us and

keep us secure under thy protection.  Grant that

the Holy Catholic Church may triumph over her

enemies, and that the Kingdom of Christ may

be propagated on earth.

Our Father, Hail Mary, glory Be.

Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima, pray for us.

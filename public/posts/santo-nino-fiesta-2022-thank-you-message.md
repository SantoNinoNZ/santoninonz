A BIG THANK YOU!!! Daghang Salamat (Many Thanks)

January 16th, 1994, one Sunday 28 years ago, we held the 1st Fiesta celebration in honour of Senor Santo Nino. How the devotions started in New Zealand is documented on the tablet we printed which is on display at the shrine of Senor Santo Nino at St Benedict’s Church. The shrine was installed thru the support of the then Parish priest Mons Paul Farmer.

  
For the past 28 years, thousands of Auckland’s Catholic Filipino community and family of devotees gathered during the fiesta celebrations in honour of the Holy Child Jesus (Señor Santo Niño) on the third Sunday of January.  
It is a moving, faith-filled event marking Señor Santo Niño’s blessing in several healings, cures and answered prayers. The devotion to the Christ-child seemed to have originated in Spain at the beginning of the 16th century and usually it emphasized the ideas of kingship. From Spain, the devotion spread to the rest of Europe. And from Europe – it spread to the other parts of the world.

  
After modest beginnings, the feast of Señor Santo Niño has grown to a major event in the Filipino-Catholic calendar, not only in the Philippines, but in most parts of the world including Auckland.  
The Devotions to Santo Nino keeps growing from strength to strength. There have been many attestations about the miracles received from Señor Santo Niño,  
although unrecorded. It is with Faith and Thanksgiving that the number of devotees who participate in the stewardship of the Church have increased.

  
A BIG THANK YOU!!!

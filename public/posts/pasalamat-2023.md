The 29th Annual Santo Nino Fiesta & Sinulog in New Zealand – 15 Jan 2023 is always an exceptional expression of Filipinos' love and devotion to the Holy Child Jesus, Senyor Santo Nino.

With hearts full of joy and with much gratitude from our heart,

we wish to thank everyone who made this Fiesta another very solemn and successful one. ALL GLORY TO GOD!!!!

We wish to thank you all for your prayers and contributions.

We wish to thank key people in this celebration:

His Grace Bishop Steve Lowe – Bishop of Auckland

Mons Bernard Kiely – Vicar General for the Diocese of Auckland

Fr Mario Dorado – Chaplain to the Auckland Catholic Filipino Chaplaincy.

Fr Nathaniel Brazil & Fr Harold Camonias, visiting priest from Australia.

Priests who presided during the 9-days novena masses at St Patrick’s Cathedral:

Mons Bernard Kiely; Fr Mario Dorado; Fr Larry Rustia; Fr Gilbert Ramos; Fr Sherwin Lapaan; Fr Sam Pulanco; Fr Carlos Guleng.

First and foremost, we would like to thank God for another milestone in our journey of faith in this beautiful land of Aotearoa, New Zealand.

29 years of holding annual devotions to Senor Santo Nino here in Auckland, New Zealand and now being held in other parts of New Zealand. Thank you to our Area Coordinators in Hastings, Palmerston North and Invercargill and of course all Area Coordinators in Auckland.

These Devotions we hold close to our heart, handed down from generations to generations, growing from strength to strength.

When in an adopted homeland, we migrants need something we can hold on to when faced with many challenges that every other migrant has gone thru.

Our belief in this Child God, Majestic King has helped us survive

the day to day struggles we encounter as we strive to inculturate into the new environment, the new homeland we call New Zealand.

The last three years of the Covid 19 virus pandemic has been difficult years for all of us and there are still news of new challenges coming up due to it, but it has never stopped us from practicing our faith.

We thank all our Kababayans, our countrymen, who extended a helping hand to those who struggled during those times of need.

As we move on, we hold close to our heart our motto for this year’s fiesta celebration and which we will live throughout the year 2023, MOVING ON, STAYING STRONG, PADAYAN TA NINO.

The phrase “PADAYAN TA NINO” is a word in our Visayan dialect which means: “Let us continue our journey with Senor Santo Nino.”

On behalf of my co-organizers and trustees, we would like to Thank Bishop Steve Lowe, Bishop Catholic Diocese of Auckland, for celebrating this momentous occasion with us and gracing our Santo Nino fiesta celebrations today.

We wish well for Bishop Emeritus Patrick Dunn for guiding us and supporting us in our devotional activities through the years.

May I thank ALL volunteers who have given their time and resources to help make another fiesta celebration a tremendous success, success even in the midst of the scare of further variants of Covid 19 and the anxiety of when we will get out of this whole situation.

VOLUNTEERS, without you, the world will have lots of services to be done but no one to do them.

Thank you to everyone who served in our Fiesta Mass Today: Ministers of Word and Extraordinary Ministers of Communion, altar servers, mass collectors & communion guides, families who brought offertory gifts, our Sacristan Carmen Shaw, Marivic Montano and Butch Rafols.

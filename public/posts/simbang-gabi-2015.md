Blessings of love and peace to everyone in our faith journey.

God is so good. He provides every opportunity for us to offer our thanksgiving to Him in every Holy Mass we attend.

For us Pinoys, the Misa de Gallo or Simbang Gabi is one of the opportunities to thank God for His bountiful blessings and a wonderful year, a tradition that is very close to our heart.

For Auckland city or Auckland CBD residents, the Simbang Gabi tradition that we ALL long to have is now just at our doorstep.

St Patrick’s Cathedral is offering Simbang Gabi at 7:30pm each evening from December 15 to 23, 7:00pm on Dec 20.

Our celebrations for Christmas continues on to our forthcoming 9-days novena-masses to Sto Nino from Jan 8 – Jan 16, 2016 also at St Patrick’s Cathedral and Jan 17, 2016 fiesta celebrations at the North Shore Events Centre.

Hope to see you all city dwellers and those who cannot make it in the early morning masses.

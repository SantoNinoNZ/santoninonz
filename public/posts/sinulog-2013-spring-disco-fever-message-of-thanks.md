SINULOG NZ SPRING DISCO FEVER 2013

28 Sep 2013

Mt Albert Senior Citizens’ Hall

To ALL our friends and benefactors:

Our Sinulog NZ Spring Disco went really well and was very well attended. I would like to thank everyone who came, supported and assisted to make the event a very successful one.

Some interesting notes on the disco:

I was stunned by those who came and really made an effort to come in their “Grease” inspired outfit. Pilar Boyle came in her Olivia-Newton John outfit and her hair was stunning. Sara Benemerito also came in with her red and white Olivia-Newton John inspired outfit. Our Emcee Ferdie Esclamado wore a John Travolta look alike suite. Arjoy came in with her attractive stripe outfit while everyone else made a great effort to dress up to our theme.

In behalf of the NZ-Filipino Sto Nino Devotees Trust, I would like to acknowledge the support of our sponsors: Cooperative Bank, Western Union and Pilar Boyle with her Urgano products and everyone who came.

There were many new faces there and of course many friends and Sto Nino devotees came along too to have fun. Everyone enjoyed the music line-up of our DJ Dexter Ycong who kept them dancing away on the floor all night.

I thank those who, with great enthusiasm, listened so intently as I shared with them some milestones for the past 20 years and where we are going to with our Sto Nino Family Centre project. I also mentioned our activities in preparation for the 20th annual Fiesta celebration for Senor Santo Nino at North Shore Events Centre which will kick-off with the the 9-days novena-masses to be held at St Patrick’s Cathedral from Jan 10, 2014 and the 2-days Sinulog Basketball Competition on Jan 10 & 11, 2014 which might be held at the North Shore Events Centre as well (to be confirmed). Alex Andales, who heads our Sinulog Basketball Competition Committee was present and was ready to take down names of groups who might want to join in. My welcome address finished with a prayer to Senor Santo Nino.

After the sumptuous meal and to break the ice, we started the evening with 3 sets of Trivia challenges prepared for us by Ado Flores. It was not only fun but a very informative exercise as well.

After the Trivia challenge, came the highlight of the night, the Disco challenge.

Alyx Ty, the Filipino’s very own Salsa Champion and the official choreographer for the cultural production for our Sto Nino Fiesta 2014, got everyone on their feet and did an excellent job with “on the spot choreography” of Grease and 2 other music from the movie theme. Upon our request, Joy Caballero and our Emcee Ferdie Esclamado accepted their task to choose the Sinulog NZ Spring Disco Kings and Queens, Best Male and Female Dancers and Most Energetic Male & Female dancers.

It was night to remember. Boboy Caballero, who was the official photographer took loads and loads of pictures. It will be very exciting to see them posted in our Sto Nino website and Facebook.

Special thanks also to Mary Anne & Pete Brannan who manned the registration table and collated the trivia answers, to Joyce Gesta who gave away our prizes and to Martin Caballero who provided a helping hand in many ways that evening.

Big thanks to Oscar’s overall management of the fundraising and flow of the evening.

I would like to mention that we did a marathon advertising on this for two weeks and Chichi Abadingo, our very gifted Website Administrator, did a very good job with capturing website registrations.

Once again , our heartfelt thanks to everyone and great thanks to Senor Santo Nino. Pit Senyor!!!!!!!!!!!

Keep an eye on our website news updates for the our pre-Christmas Family Disco in November and perhaps the first counting of votes for our Festival Queen candidates.

God bless us all

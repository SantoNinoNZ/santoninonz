HAPPY FIESTA! PIT SENYOR!!!

9-days Novena-Masses and Fiesta of Senor Santo Nino in New Zealand 2021 celebrated with very grateful hearts. A BIG THANK YOU TO ALL GENEROUS AND KIND HEARTS!!!

Thank You Bishop Michael Gielen – Auxiliary Bishop of Auckland for your warm presence at the Santo Nino Fiesta 2021. Fr Mario Dorado – Chaplain to the Auckland Catholic Filipino Chaplaincy.Fr Sherwin Lapaan, Parish Priest St Mark's Parish, Pakuranga.Fr Carlo Cruz – Assisting priest at St Joseph’s Takapuna

Priests who presided during the 9-days novena masses:Mons Bernard Kiely; Fr Mario Dorado; Fr Larry Rustia; Fr Gilbert Ramos; Fr Sherwin Lapaan; Fr Sam Pulanco; Fr Carlo Cruz; Fr Carlos Guleng; Fr Rodney Smythe.

First and foremost, I would like to thank God for another milestone in our journey of faith in this beautiful land of Aotearoa, New Zealand. 27 years of holding annual devotions to Senor Santo Nino here in Auckland. Devotions we hold close to our heart, handed down from generations to generations, growing from strength to strength.When in an adopted homeland, we migrants need something we can hold on to when faced with many challenges that every other migrant has gone thru. Our belief in this Child God, Majestic King has helped us survive the day to day struggles we encounter as we strive to inculturate into the new environment, the new homeland we call New Zealand. 2020 has been a difficult year for all of us but it never stopped us from practicing our faith because of the presence of virtual masses and, virtual prayer meetings.

We thank all our Kababayans, our countrymen, who extended a helping hand to those who struggled during these times of need. Yes, news of this unprecedented global health crises may have shaken us. We faced so many uncertainties. But as the song goes, “WALK WITH FAITH IN YOUR HEART”. “WE MAY NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS, BUT WE KNOW WHO HOLDS THE FUTURE.”

On behalf of our co-organizers and trustees, we would like to Thank Bishop Pat Dunn for guiding us and supporting us in our devotional activities through the years. Very special thanks to Bishop Michael Gielen for taking time to celebrate mass and be with us today. May I thank ALL volunteers who have given their time and resources to help make another fiesta celebration a tremendous success. Success even in the midst of the fear of Covid 19 and the anxiety of when we will be able to get the vaccine. VOLUNTEERS, without you, the world will have lots of services to be done but no one to do them. Thank you to everyone who served in the Mass Today: Ministers of Word and Extraordinary Ministers of Communion, altar servers, families who brought offertory gifts. Fiesta choir: The awesome HUNI (Holy Cross Papatoetoe Filipino choir) Various Filipino choirs who supported us during these 9 days of prayer: Devotional groups and community groups who have joined us and supported us every year for the past 27 years.

To our Patrons for the fiesta:Mr & Mrs Rex & Joan Yap of NZ Home Loans; Florencio & Serinia Caupit; Ramon & Nympha Marinas; Judith Hastings & Family; AS Juinio & Family; Rexy & Boyet Jose & Family; The Flores Family. To all our Patrons all thru the 9-days Novena-masses – Thank you!!!

Being one of the 2015 Sinulog Festival Queens was definitely a great opportunity. 2015 itself was a great year, and being able to participate in such a religious and culture-filled fiesta has helped start it all. I can't find words to describe it all, but what lessons I learned from such an experience is worth while. I learned how to be confident, to be proud, to be involved, to be religious and to be a Filipino. I met fellow devotees to Señor Santo Niño, forming lasting friendships and creating life long memories that I will never forget. The year went by too fast, but that won't stop me from continuing my devotion to Señor Santo Niño for he was the reason I accepted this opportunity. So I wish good luck to the 2016 Sinulog Festival Queens, remember to enjoy every moment of this journey. Viva Pit Senyor!

My experience being a part of the 2015 Sinulog Festival Queen NZ pageant has been very rewarding and one of the best things I've done! I feel very priveleged and honored to have been able to express my undying faith, love & devotion to our Balaang Sto Niño. I got to meet and become really good friends with my fellow contestants and I feel that the friendships I had made, are friendships I will cherish forever. My advice to the Sinulog Queens of 2016 is to be yourself, be confident and just have lots of fun! You will enjoy your experience a lot if you be yourself. One piece of advice that I think is the most important, is to dedicate everything you do, to Sto Niño. The reason behind why we celebrate is because of him, and from my experience, putting all my faith into him boosted my confidence so much, and helped me get through everything I needed to, so good luck to all you 2016 Queens, ishagit og kusog…VIVA PIT SENYOR!!!!

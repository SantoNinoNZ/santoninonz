Kia Ora!

**_We would like to invite you to participate in an exciting training program involving the youth in our community._**

From January of 2010, the children making up the Sinulog Drumline has become the crowd drawer of the annual Sinulog festival and since then have been invited to perform in cultural events around Auckland. This group is made up of a very enthusiastic mix of 20 boys and girls from ages 10 to 18. It is an entertaining group that is skilled and talented – born from the heart of the NZ-Filipino Devotees of Senyor Sto Nino.

As a community organization, we strive for the youth of the drum line to develop team work, self-discipline, leadership, a successful attitude as well as maintain integrity along with supporting our community values. We encourage each member to achieve personal greatness while they enjoy improving their unique talents and increase their determination to push their skills to extraordinary levels of excellence.

**How can you help?**

The Sinulog Drumline relies on community support through sponsorships as they march towards excellence. Here are just a few of the ways your participation and donation dollars will be put to work this year:

 Transportation of drummers to the regular monthly band practices

 A Semi Trailer to move the band to participate in events around Auckland and neighbouring cities on invitation

We are an official non-profit organization so any donations made to the group are tax deductible. Without your participation, the drumline would be very difficult and expensive to operate. Players and parents volunteer their time without any compensation. No money is used to compensate for initial equipment costs or used as profit for anyone.

Please contact us should you have any questions. Again, thank you for your support, and we look forward to your participation in this program.

**Help us mould the children to reach their potential through music.  Help us nurture these young seeds of hope and to cultivate positive values in our youth.**

We need your help. Please contact:

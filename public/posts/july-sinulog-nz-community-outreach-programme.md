Thank you to the Sinulog NZ Community Programme Volunteers who came to the Edmund Hillary Retirement Village

“Dedicated hearts like yours  
Are not so easy to find.  
It takes a special person to be  
So generous and kind.

To care so much for your fellow man  
Is a quality all too rare.  
Yet you give of your time and talents,  
For all in need to share.

So thank you for being a volunteer,  
We're privileged to work with you.  
We want you to know how appreciated you are,  
Not just today, but the whole year through.”

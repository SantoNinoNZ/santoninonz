 When God seems so far away, we send him messages written on paper and tie it to a balloon. Then, we let the balloon fly to the heavens. Hoping and believing that it gets there.

**_“If you lose hope, somehow you lose the vitality that keeps life moving, you lose that courage to be, that quality that helps you go on in spite of it all. And so today I still have a dream.” Martin Luther King, Jr._**

_During the mass at the Basilica, people tie papers with petitions & prayers to balloons. When the song “Bato Balani sa Gugma” is sang, the balloons are released into the skies. Each person waves the right hand to the balloons and to the heavens during the song's chorus._ KANAMO MALOOY KA UNTA

NGA KANIMO NANGILABA  
(translated to “Please have mercy on us. To Thee we prostrate, begging, pleading”)

Apart from the Sinulog street parade and procession, the mass at the Basilica is one of the most crowded event during the feast. They patiently line up (for hours) to get close enough to the image to touch it. Why do people go?

… so He will remember the familiar face in the crowd that sends him balloons and waves at him year after year. Hoping he sends back miracles.

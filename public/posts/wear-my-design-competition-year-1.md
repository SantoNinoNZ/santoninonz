This year, we are launching the ‘Wear My Design Competition' . Our 2015 Sinulog Festival Queens will be parading the designs of 6 Auckland Couturiers.

Meet Designer #1. ANDREW (&REW)

Andrew (&REW) is a 20 year old Fashion Design student at AUT. He moved to New Zealand from Davao City with his family at the age of 4.  From a young age he has always shown an interest in creative arts which is no surprise he later discovered his love for fashion in high school. Currently in his last year of study he has already won several design competitions and experienced working in the industry. He cites Romance Was Born, Alon Livne and David Koma as his design inspirations. His favourite Filipino Designers are Furne Amato, Francis Libiran and Michael Cinco.

Sinulog Festival Queen Johna Mae Nazareno will be &Drew's Muse.

Meet Designer #2. DENNIS SAYAT

Fashion design has always been my passion. Glamour and Elegance is my forte. I love creating outfits that fits my client's personality.  
  
I have always been a devotee of the Sto. Nino and designing a custome for the Sinulog Festival Queen candidate would be great oppurtunity for me to be a part of the celebration and it is somehow my way of giving back for all the graces and blessings that has been given to me.  
  
May the Young Jesus Christ bestow his blessings to all of us this year and the years to come. Happy Sinulog…VIVA PIT SENYOR!

Dennis will weave his magic on Sinulog Festival Queen Maegan Perdido

Meet Designer #3. GINNO GOMEZ

Creativity, uniqueness and indigenous are my line of expertise. In my years of experience, I was able to mold my craft and be an inspiration, the works of hands truly gives glory to God, without Him I cannot create great things. My ultimate ambition is to be a world known designer, florist and event specialist, and be a “status symbol”.  
  
Passion and craftsmanship are my strong point when it comes to designing. I put my heart in everything my hands touches and my mind conceived. So, to be a designer is all about patience and perseverance, pushing yourself to the limits, thinking the unthinkable and drafting all possibilities, with God's help all is possible for impossible spells I, M -possible.

Ginno Gomez will be designing the gown to be worn by Sinulog Festival Queen  Metzil Bermudez.

Meet Designer #4. Jasmine Rose Wohnsiedler

Fashion is my first love and it inspired me to take up fashion and design.  
  
For me, everyday is a fashion show and the road we are travelling is my ramp stage. I pursue what I love most and doing it for others is a great privilege.  
  
Sharpness to details and hard work are my motivation…I use my skills on details plus elaboration…For me the saying: simplicity is beauty doesn't exist for my philosophy is “exaggerate with less is perfection.”  
  
I am the reigning MS. QUEEN OF THE WORLD INTERNATIONAL 2012 NEW ZEALAND

Jasmine will be crafting the gown of Sinulog Festival Queen Althea Daculan

Meet Designer #6. XYRENE COPE

My name is Xyrene Cope. I am one of the Queen Candidates for Sinulog Festival 2015 and I will be designing my own gown. I have been an art student for at least 5 years. This is my first time designing a dress and I think it's a good learning opportunity. I decided to make my own dress because I was heavily influenced by art nouveau design. Although they do not make clothes or design clothes, I believe that I can implement their design into my gown. I am thankful that I have been given this skill and would like to showcase my talent by designing my own gown.

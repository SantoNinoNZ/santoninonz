A Morning Offering to the Holy Child

Illustrated InfantO Dear sweet Infant Jesus,  
I offer You my will, that You  
strengthen it, my mind that  
You inspire it; my memory  
that You fill it;  
my wishes and desires, that You  
cleanse them, I sacrifice to You;  
my intentions that You guide them, all my inner and outer activities, that You make them sacred. All I am and all I have is Yours. Your love for me is my hope and trust. Hear me and grant that I may never leave you. Amen

O Infant Jesus, I form the belief that I shall be granted forgiveness of sins and place it into the hands of Your most Holy Mother Mary; I commend myself to all and every Holy Mass that is celebrated this day and all over the globe, and I offer all this on behalf of the poor souls of purgatory.

(Resolve to fight your greatest evil today and to perform several acts of the opposite virtue because of your love for the Holy Child Jesus.)

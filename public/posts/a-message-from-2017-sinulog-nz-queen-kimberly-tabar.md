Before I joined Sinulog Festival Queen, I was actually encountering a lot of personal issues in my life. When I heard that the team was looking for a new set of candidates for 2017, I did not hesitate to say no to a friend’s offer because I also wanted to make some time for myself during that period. I actually just joined and surrendered myself to Snr. Sto Nino, hoping that He will help me with what I am going through that time.

When I joined the pageant, I did not just gained a new set of family members but I also gained a stronger faith towards Snr. Sto Nino. Also, after serving Snr. Sto Nino as one of the Sinulog Festival Queens, I was able to survive nursing school. Believe me or not but getting a degree in nursing is not an easy task. Surviving nursing school requires alot courage, determination and most importantly, it requires lot of faith. It was like Snr. Sto Nino was giving back to me during my nursing journey by serving Him as a Sinulog Festival Queen.

I am not just thankful to Snr. Sto Nino for all the blessings that I have received so far but also I want to thank my parents for giving me the opportunity to be one of the Sinulog Festival Queens. It changed me into a much stronger individual and a much more hopeful person knowing that He will always be there to help me encounter all the failures and challenges in my life. I guarantee you that once you surrender everything to Snr. Sto Nino, all those pain and sufferings will be replaced with happiness and success.

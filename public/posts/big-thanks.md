VIVA SENOR SANTO NINO!!! PIT SENOR!!!

**Another huge blessing from God, another celebration greatly blessed by Senor Santo Niño thru everyone He has sent to support the devotions in every way.**

For 21 Years now here in Auckland, New Zealand, the church has witnessed the immense growth of devotions to Senor Santo Nino (Holy Child Jesus).

Every night during the 9-days novena-masses held from Jan 9 – Jan 17, 2015 saw hundreds of devotees flocking to St Patrick’s Cathedral, Wyndham Street, Auckland and filling the church to nearly overflowing.

It is so uplifting to see people so happy but intensely worshipping the Holy Infant Jesus (Senor Santo Niño).

People’s faces lit with joy when they finish off each night’s mass with a Sinulog Dance Offering. It is likewise a delight to see so many non-Filipino devotees joining us in these devotions each night at St Patrick’s Cathedral.

**Then comes the huge fiesta celebration of Senor Santo Niño, January 18, 2015**.  We think North Shore Events Centre, Auckland is a huge place for the celebration but it is likewise fully packed with devotees wishing to finish off the 10th day of prayers and celebrations, a token of their love and gratitude to SENOR SANTO for all His bountiful blessings, for answered prayers and likewise unanswered prayers and the minute by minute miracles that He continues to perform in our life, although we may not consciously be aware of them.

**Thank you to all devotees, our co-organizers and everyone who made this another great and successful celebration**.  It will take us a long time to itemize everyone who has helped us in many, many ways but I would like to mention some people who have made a huge impact because of their Prayerful support, their dedication and commitment:

That is when we get the guidance on how to carry out His Will.**

Help us bring more people to Senor Santo Niño by promoting devotions to Him thru the house pilgrimage of the blessed statue of Senor Santo Nino.

**Oh Senor Santo Niño, bless and protect us always.**

Love and prayers,

Tito Oscar and Tita Miriam

Greetings of Peace in the Lord. Pit Senyor!
===========================================

We are pleased to invite you to the 19th annual celebration of the feast of  **Señor Santo Niño, the Holy Infant Jesus.** The pious tradition of the Sto Niño is a story rich in both history and devotion.The Sto. Niño is looked upon as a powerful symbol of faith. Many have shared stories of His miracles. Ordinary people from different walks of life attest to how the Sto Niño has granted their petitions and answered their prayers. Each year, the number of devotees have increased with the ‘**panaad**‘ (promise) to start the year with a renewed life and spirit.

Here in New Zealand**, w**e have all gonea long way in our devotions to Him and continue in our commitment to bring more devotees to our beloved Patron, Señor Santo Niño. Year after year, we have been blessed with so many people working together to make each and every fiesta a memorable and joyful event,  **giving Glory and Honour to God.** Once again, we will celebrate another milestone in our devotions and give thanks to God the Father for the numerous blessings received from Him in our devotions to His Son.  

The Fiesta Theme for 2013 is “**Blessed are the Peacemakers – Faith and Action through Peacemaking**”

_“Blessed are the peacemakers” will be the eighth Message of Pope Benedict XVI for the Celebration of World Day of Peace. Pacem in Terris (Latin for “Peace on Earth”) strives to facilitate the active participation of people and organizations, especially the religious community, on issues and projects relevant to the quest for peace, justice, and sustainability throughout the world. We seek to change attitudes and actions and to help people understand that peace is a necessity, now and in the future._

_The upcoming Year of Faith is an opportunity for every Catholic to turn towards Jesus, encounter him in the Sacraments, especially the Eucharist and rediscover the Faith and Church. We are summoned to an authentic and renewed conversion to the Lord, the One Savior of the world._

**Our celebration starts with 9 days of Novena and Mass from January 11 – 19, 2013  to be held at the Good Shepherd Church, Telford Avenue, Balmoral.**

We look forward to your assistance in helping us carry out the different tasks required to achieve an environment of devotion and prayer in preparation for the Fiesta.  As we continue to proclaim God’s love by our words and actions we pray for another successful celebration of our dedication to our Beloved Senyor Sto Niño. Let us be His hands, feet, eyes and body here on earth.

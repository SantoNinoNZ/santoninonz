**Jubilee Year 2025 – Pilgrims of Hope**

We are immensely grateful to God Almighty for uniting us in our devotions to Senor Santo Nino over the past 31 years here in Auckland, New Zealand. Each year, our community of devotees continues to grow, and it is truly awe-inspiring to witness how the Child Jesus draws so many hearts to Him, especially during the 9-day novena masses and the grand fiesta celebration.

The sight of devotees' eyes lighting up with devotion and joy as they sing the Song to Senor Santo Nino and light their candles during these solemn celebrations is nothing short of magical. The beautiful message of love in the singing of Bato Balani Sa Gugma reaffirms the presence of Jesus in every moment of our lives.

Our prayer is that the special blessings and joy we experience during these 9 days of prayer will flow into our daily lives, helping us face life's challenges with unwavering trust and confidence in God.

**As we prepared our message for this special day, we reflected on Jubilee 2025.**

Pope Francis has declared 2025 as a year of Jubilee with the theme ‘Pilgrims of Hope', giving voice to his desire for the year to foster a greater sense of global sisterhood and brotherhood, solidarity with the poor, and caring for the environment.

Jubilees are designed to be a time of conversion and increased emphasis on God’s mercy and forgiveness of sins.

**Jubilee Year Prayer**

**Father in heaven, may the _faith_ you have given us  
in your son, Jesus Christ, our brother, and the flame of _charity_ enkindled in our hearts by the Holy Spirit,  
reawaken in us the blessed hope for the coming of your Kingdom.**

**May your grace transform us into tireless cultivators of the seeds of the Gospel. May those seeds transform from within both humanity and the whole cosmos in the sure expectation of a new heaven and a new earth,  
when, with the powers of Evil vanquished, your glory will shine eternally.**

**May the grace of the Jubilee reawaken in us, _Pilgrims of Hope_,  
a yearning for the treasures of heaven. May that same grace spread  
the joy and peace of our Redeemer throughout the earth.  
To you our God, eternally blessed, be glory and praise for ever.**

**Amen.**

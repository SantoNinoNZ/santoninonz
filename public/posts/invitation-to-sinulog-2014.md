Subject: INVITATION TO ALL DEVOTEES OF SENYOR SANTO NINO
========================================================

Greetings of Peace in the Lord. Pit Senyor!

We are pleased to invite you to the 20th annual celebration of the feast of Señor Santo Niño, the Holy Infant Jesus. The pious tradition of the Sto Niño is a story rich in both history and devotion.The Sto. Niño is looked upon as a powerful symbol of faith. Many have shared stories of His miracles. Ordinary people from different walks of life attest to how the Sto Niño has granted their petitions and answered their prayers. Each year, the number of devotees have increased with the ‘panaad' (promise) to start the year with a renewed life and spirit.

Here in New Zealand, we have gone a long way in our devotions to Señor Santo Nino and continue in our commitment to bring more devotees to our beloved Patron, Señor Santo Niño. Year after year, we have been blessed with so many people working together to make each and every fiesta a memorable and joyful event, giving Glory and Honour to God. Once again, we will celebrate another milestone in our devotions and give thanks to God the Father for the numerous blessings received from Him in our devotions to His Son.

The Fiesta Theme for 2014 is “Brotherhood and Peace” adapted from Pope Francis’ message for the Jan.1, 2014 World Day of Peace is that living a life of fraternity can lead to peace for a world struggling with many tragedies.

An Excerpt: “Fraternity,” says the communiqué, “is a dowry that every man and every woman brings with himself or herself as a human being, as a child of the one Father.”

Our celebration starts with 9 days of Novena and Mass from January 10 – 18, 2014 to be held at St Patrick’s Cathedral, 43 Wyndham St, Auckland. Highlight of the celebration is the Fiesta Mass to be celebrated by Bishop Patrick Dunn, Bishop of Auckland at North Shore Events Centre January 19, 2014.

The 10-days celebration includes a two-day Sinulog NZ Basketball League also to be held at North Shore Events Centre on Jan 11 & 12, 2014 from 8:30AM.

We look forward to your assistance in helping us carry out the different tasks required to achieve an environment of devotion and prayer in preparation for the Fiesta. As we continue to proclaim God’s love by our words and actions we pray for another successful celebration of our dedication to our Beloved Senyor Sto Niño. Let us be His hands, feet, eyes and body here on earth.

A schedule with special intentions for each day will follow shortly.

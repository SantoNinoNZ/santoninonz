Many people have asked us, on many occasions, on how they can help with the 9-days novena-masses and the fiesta celebrations for our beloved Senor Santo Nino.

The most important contribution you can make is to help us spread the news and invite your family, friends and community to the upcoming 9-days novena-masses which will start 12 Jan – 20 Jan 2018 at St Patrick’s Cathedral and the fiesta celebrations on 21 Jan 2018.

Detailed information can be found on our Sinulog website, **[www.santo-nino.org](http://www.santo-nino.org/)** and on our Facebook page **SINULOG IN NEW ZEALAND.**

The other contribution you can make is to join and help us recruit more people, the young and the more “matured” ones, to join any of the 3 Sinulog Dances that are being put together for the fiesta celebrations and the Sinulog Liturgical Dance for Jan 12 & Jan 21.

These Sinulog dances, including the Liturgical dance, is a prayer dance offering or HALAD to Senor Santo Nino.  Some offer it as thanksgiving, others offer it together with prayer intentions.

You can also help invite the young people to join the Sinulog drumline group & majorettes group.

Practices  are held Tuesday & Thursday from 7pm to 8:30pm and Saturdays from 1pm to 4pm.

Venue: **St Benedict’s Hall** (some practices may also be held at other venues when advised)

Parking:

The other contribution you can make is to help us with our Annual Fundraising campaign. We do this thru our raffle tickets selling.

There are many other ways you can help us.  Come and see us to discuss.

God is never outdone in generosity. Let us offer Him our **T**ime, **T**alent and **T**reasure.

May God’s continued blessings be upon us all. Pit Senyor!!!!

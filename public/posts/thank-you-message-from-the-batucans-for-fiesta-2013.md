**VIVA SENOR SANTO NINO!   PIT SENOR!!!**

To EVERYONE  who has helped make the 19th Annual Fiesta Celebrations solemn and very successful, starting from the 9-days novena-masses to the actual fiesta celebrations.

A VERY SPECIAL THANK YOU TO YOU FOR YOUR IMMEASURABLE KINDNESS AND GENEROSITY.

I cannot possibly mention everyone but I would like to offer a warm and sincere thanks to groups and some people who accepted to take on board some tasks and who sacrificed their personal time to fulfill these.

Kindly read thru my list. I tried to make it as exhaustive as possible. My sincere apologies if I may have missed anyone inadvertently.

THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS.

God bless us all

Oscar and Miriam Batucan

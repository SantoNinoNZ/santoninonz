During World War II, every time the Japanese bomber planes approached the city of Cebu, the people would rush to the church and pray to the Sto.Nino for deliverance. Soon enough, there would be strong winds driving the bombs to the sea.

Cebu City was not devastated by Japanese bombings. It only suffered destruction when the Americans bombed Japanese installations in the city during its liberation.

Greetings of love and peace to all our fellow Senyor Sto Niño devotees!  
Christmas is less than 3 months away; thisalso means the Sinulog festivities is around the corner.  
The Sinulog NZ Cultural Committee would like to invite you to 2 information sessions to open up discussions.

Both sessions will take place at St Benedict's Crypt:  
6th October (Thurs) – 7pm  
8th October (Sat) – 1pm

  
Topics to cover include practice dates/times, flow of the festivities, Sinulog Queen, Sinulog Drumline, etc.

  
Keen to know more? Please come along, we would love to see you.  
Thank you and have a blessed weekend

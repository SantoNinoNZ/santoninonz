**To everyone who have worked so hard to make all our activities, novena-masses and events for Senyor Santo Nino so blessed by God and by your presence, we would like to celebrate.**

**A Good way to celebrate our working together is to have fun together.**

**This time we want to hold our Youth & Family Event in an open space where everyone, the “****Young****”, the “****Not so Young****” and the “****Young Once****” can really enjoy and have a very relaxing time in open air, with some cool breeze and watch the kids have fun.**

**Sunday November 30 at Cornwall Park from 1pm to 4-5pm.Please bring a plate to share. Also bring a 10$ worth of gift for Gift Exchange.  
**

**We believe this would be a good time for all as everyone can get really busy as soon as December draws in?**

**We need volunteers to get the day rolling with lots of surprises and fun. You don’t have to be an expert,**

**But you will have lots of humour and can create so much fun.**

**We’ll have lots of prizes on the run.**

DAGHANG SALAMAT SENOR SANTO NINO (THANK YOU SENOR SANTO NINO) VIVA PIT SENOR!!!!

The overwhelming attendance during the 9-days Novena-masses at St Patrick;s Cathedral, Auckland, New Zealand and the solemn mass of thanksgiving that highlighted the Annual celebration of the Fiesta of Senor Santo Nino, on its 20th year in Auckland, resounded the great love and devotion for Senor Santo Nino by the huge number of people that flocked to St Patrick’s Cathedral each night.

The big crowd that danced the Sinulog every night at St Patrick;s Cathedral during the 9-days novena-masses was a joy to behold.

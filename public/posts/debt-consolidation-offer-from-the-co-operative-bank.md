To all our Friends and Families,

The Cooperative Bank Limited has been very supportive of the SANTO NINO Project for a Pilgrim Centre and has been a corporate partner to the Annual Sto Nino Fiestas and Cultural Festival and the quarterly SANTO NINO sponsored community activities.

They are running a new debt consolidation offer and they give a further .5% discount on the interest rate if 2 insurances are taken with the loan. Any loan referrals from Sto Nino will get S donation to SANTO NINO once the loan is drawn down.

As a Major Patron of SANTO NINO Annual and Quarterly events and the Project for a SANTO NINO Pilgrim Centre, we support them in this promotion.

May we, in turn, request your help in forwarding this message to your FRIENDS, FAMILIES, DEVOTEES and SUPPORTERS of SENOR SANTO NINO who we may not be able to reach.

You can contact Joyce Gesta of the Cooperative Bank, Onehunga Branch on her work Phone 09 622 9066 or perhaps her Mobile 027 509 7256.

VIVA SENOR SANTO NINO!! PIT SENYOR!!

Thank you for your continued support to the Devotion to SENOR SANTO NINO and our projects and activities. This offer is open to everyone including our non-Filipino friends and you will get a special discount and some privileges if you say you are a supporter of SANTO NINO.

Tito Oscar and Tita Miriam

To ALL our Beautiful and Adorable Candidates for the Sinulog Festival Queen 2015 competition:

First of all, on behalf of the NZ-Filipino Devotees of Santo Nino group, I would like to thank you for your commitment to support the upcoming fiesta of Senor Santo Nino on Jan 18, 2015 and some major events in 2015.

The project on the Sinulog Festival Queen Competition is geared towards bringing together our young people and give them the opportunity to showcase their gifts and talents, meet new friends and create camaraderie amongst them.

In 2015, we will also run, for the first time, the WEAR MY DESIGN completion. This will give a chance to our gifted designers to showcase their talents.  Their design will be modelled by the candidates themselves.

We thank you and appreciate your support.

God bless

Tito Oscar and Tita Miriam

This community outreach program is about showing that you can do an act of kindness that doesn't cost anything. Men, women and children volunteered to sing, dance and present their talents and time for residents at their local aged-care homes

Each year, the project sees more and more volunteers putting smiles on more people's faces.

“Our talents are the gift that God gives to us… What we make of our talents is our gift back to God”

Thank you to the Voice of God CCR Family Choir, Duting brothers – Josh, Benjamin and Miquel. Special thanks choreographer Joanne Patricia, costume organizer Christine Repizo, support from Michael Duting and Christy Marie Magallon. Thank you Jun Morales and staff at Edmund Hillary Retirement Village for the hospitality

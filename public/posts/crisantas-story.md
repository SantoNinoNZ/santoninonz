IT STARTED with a prayer for her son 35 years ago.

In 1975, Crisanta Largo Dayanan's son, then 10 years old, was having a hard time breathing. He also suffered from a massive headache.

With few options left to her, Crisanta knelt in front of an image of the Sto. Niño praying for her son's life.

Paghuman gyud nako'g ampo, nawala gud dayon ang sakit sa iya ulo. Pagkaugma ana, daghan kaayong dugo nga nitulo sa iyang dunggan (Right after my prayer, the pain in his head disappeared. Then blood flowed from his ear), she recalled.

After that, her son went about as if nothing had happened to him.

After that incident, which she believes was a miracle, Dayanan has since sworn that wherever her feet may take her in life, each year, she would come to Cebu City to celebrate the Feast of the Sto. Niño in January.

Originally from Toledo City's barangay Lutopan, Dayanan since moved to Bayugan, Agusan Del Sur in 1988. Yet she has kept her promise to always come to Cebu City for the fiesta, especially since the Sto. Niño has addressed many of her concerns since then.

 Dayanan, now a 70-year-old widow, continue on her yearly pilgrimage to give homage to the miracle worker who she owed his sons' life.

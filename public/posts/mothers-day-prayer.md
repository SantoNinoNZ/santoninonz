**The Prayer**

**Spiritual Armour of Prayer**

**For all Mothers amongst our Families, Sto Nino Devotees and Friends**Â **and Everyone Giving Motherly Care**

**Heavenly Father, We ask You today**

**for Your Truth, As a belt tight around our waists.**

**We put on the zeal, To announce Your good news of peace,**

**As shoes for our feet.**

**We put on Your righteousness, O Christ, As our breastplate.**

**And the hope of salvation, As a helmet for our head.**

**Father, we take up faith, As a shield which is able**

**To put out, ALL the fiery darts of the enemy.**

**And the sword of the Spirit, Which is Your Word, O Lord.**

**Father may the love, With which You loved Jesus,**

**Be in us and may Jesus be in us.**

**We ask you for the grace, Of a servant heart.**

**From: Tito Oscar, Tita Miriam and the NZ-Filipino Sto Nino Devotees**

**THANK YOU NEW ZEALAND**

*   **for all the help extended to the victims of the Super Typhoon Haiyan and to those who succumbed to the 7.2 magnitude earthquake that hit two weeks earlier.**

A Candle Lighting Service and Prayer

30 Nov 2013

**Part I – Remembering those who lost their lives**

(Led by Miriam Batucan, in place of Bishop Pat Dunn who was not able to attend due to prior engagement)

Let us remember those who lost their lives in the successive calamities that afflicted the Philippines, from the casualties of Super Typhoon Haiyan or Yolanda that claimed the lives of nearly 7,000 people including children, the young and the elderly and left nearly 9 million homeless.

Let us also remember the 100 people who succumbed to the 7.2 magnitude earthquake that hit the central islands of Cebu and Bohol just two weeks earlier and reduced local churches and houses to rubble.

We pray to God our Father, whose power brings us to birth, whose providence guides our lives, and by whose command we return to dust.

Lord, those who die still live in Your presence, their lives change but do not end. We pray in hope for all these people who lost their lives and all the dead known to You alone.

In company with Christ, Who died and now lives, may they rejoice in Your kingdom, where all our tears are wiped away. Unite us together again in one family, to sing Your praise forever and ever

We ask this through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

**Part II – We pray for the survivors of the series of disasters that struck the Philippines, the super Typhoon Haiyan and the massive earthquake that hit two weeks earlier.**

(Led by a Malaysian Pastor from a Christian group)

Let us pray for our brothers and sisters who are suffering, grieving and confused because of the calamities that ripped their world apart.

Many still face a daily battle for survival. They are traumatized and the journey to restoration will be long and hard for them.

Let us continue to pray and offer help in any way we can to assure them that they are not alone and will never be alone.

Although many people in the Philippines seek solace in their churches, for some the disaster was proving a severe test of their faith.

May the love that everyone brings to them strengthen them and inspire them to live in hope.

We ask this this through Christ our Lord. Amen

**Part III – We pray for those who are Helping, Serving and Contributing.**

(Led by Pastor Nilo from a Christian group)

We pray for ALL the 131 nations who have sent help to the Philippines, those who have been working at the shattered sites from Day 1, all people from overseas who have been sending help in one way or another, all the volunteers from the neighbouring islands who have come to offer their time and effort and everyone who are offering prayers unceasingly.

We pray that ALL the workers and contributors will not be overwhelmed by the magnitude of the calamity and that they will always be guided in doing what is right no matter how small.

We thank ALL the people of New Zealand, the NZ government and military, John Campbell and UNICEF, NZ Red Cross , various churches and church groups in New Zealand and all concerted efforts in sending relief to the people in the Philippines.

May God bless them all for their generosity.

**Final Prayers for All**

Let us pray that there will be no further casualties. Let us pray for God’s blessing on all who have joined us in this event today, especially the organizers.

Let us ALL continue to be determined and inspired in sending charity.

Amidst darkness and gloom, let us light up our candles of hope for all those who are suffering and grieving.

**THANK YOU NEW ZEALAND. May God continue to defend us and protect us.**

In thanksgiving, let us pray together the Universal prayer that Jesus Himself taught us. Let us hold our hands together as a sign of solidarity and continued support for our fellowmen as we pray:

**OUR FATHER**

**Our Father, who are in heaven**

**Hallowed be Thy Name**

**Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done**

**On earth, as it is in heaven.**

**Give us this day our daily bread.**

**And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.**

**And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.**

**For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen.**

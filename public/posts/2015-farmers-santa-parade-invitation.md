For the first time ever, the NZ-Filipino Devotees of Senyor Sto. Niῆo has committed to participate in the 2015 Santa Parade (in Auckland)!  
We would like to extend a heartfelt invitation to all the fellow devotees (and your family and friends) to represent us in the 2015 Farmer’s Santa Parade (pre-parade).  
The event will take place on the 29th November 2015 (with rain date on the 6th Dec 2015).  
We would love to have around 50 participants (the more, the merrier): people from all ages and background. I am calling all the NZ Sinulog Queens to support this event, please mark this in your diary!  

Please register your interest to be a participant by clicking on the link : [2015 Santa Parade Registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hs4sexNb-LNhAQ07lbzBX2LIqBOLTlVBTU59PF3lYoE/viewform?usp=send_form)

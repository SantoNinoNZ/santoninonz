THE SHRINE & CHAPEL PROJECT

To build a Shrine and Chapel where we can practice our religious customs, culture and traditions and promote them to the younger generation.

PROJECT PLAN

The NZ – FILIPINO DEVOTEES OF SENYOR STO NIÑO TRUST will continue its fund raising activities so as to pursue the Project for a Shrine for Senyor Sto Nino which will have a Chapel for Perpetual Adoration and a Counselling Centre.

One of the ways you can show your support for the project is through joining The Co-operative Bank.

The Co-operative Bank and the NZ – Filipino Devotees of Senyor Sto Niño Trust has put together a special banking package for all devotees, friends and family members. To receive these great offers, all you need to do is mention the NZ-
Filipino Devotees of Senyor Sto Niño when you take out the products. To find your nearest branch click here .

The Co-operative Bank will make a donation to the Trust for loans taken out. The donations we receive from
the Bank will be used to build a shrine for Senyor Sto Niño.

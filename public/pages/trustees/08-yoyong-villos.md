JEWEL VILLOS, raised by Sto Nino devotees in Cagayan de Oro, arrived in New Zealand on April 2014 that marked her long distance relationship with her family which she was not accustomed to. By God's grace she found her place working as a business lecturer in a Private Tertiary Education provider which helped her settle and further her knowledge in Adult Tertiary education. Jewel is currently working as a Faculty Academic Lead at NZMA designing academic programmes for accreditation to NZQA. Outside of work, she is the brain and hand behind Tinapay Atbp where you get your mouth watering milky Cheese Rolls. With Jewel's high energy, and entrepreneurial spirit, you'll also find her in various Filipino events. Jewel and her husband, Robert are also proud members of the Couples for Christ West Auckland Chapter.

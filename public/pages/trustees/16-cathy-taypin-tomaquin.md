CATHY TOMAQUIN.  I'm currently working at Auckland Council. I've been a Santo Ni√±o devotee here in Auckland, NZ for 20+ years and became one of the trustees 4 years ago. I am also the Area Coordinator within Glenfield, Albany & wider North Shore areas where I explore Santo Nino for those families who wish a visit in their homes. Growing up in Cebu, I have always been a devotee and it is mandatory in my family to annually attend the Novena and Sinulog Festival. Over the 
years, it is fascinating to see how much it has evolved and to see Filipinos all over NZ gather. May people's devotions keep going and be passed on.

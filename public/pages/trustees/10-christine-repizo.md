CHRISTINE REPIZO. Born and raised in Cebu, Philippines. I have been a Sto Nino devotee since a kid tagging along my mom. I am grateful to be part of NZ Sinulog and continue my devotion not only personally but along side others of the same faith. I have been blessed working as accountant in multinational companies in NZ and pursue my hobbies in baking and sewing. Equally grateful for the blessings our family received. Viva Pit Senyor.

We are truly blessed and honoured to be part of the annual celebration of the Sinulog festival in New Zealand and in spreading the devotion to Senor Sto. Nino. In our own little ways, we hope we have inspired our children, friends, relatives, and other devout Catholics to continue with this tradition and instil this belief in the younger generations. It is in good faith that we pass the responsibilities to the incoming Hermano and Hermana to pass the blessings to families through the prayers of Novena to Senor Sto. Nino. May 2017 bring love, peace, and healing to each and every one of us, our country and all nations, starting from our family. Viva Pit Senor!

It is with great honour and a wonderful benison for us all to be part of the 2016 Sinulog Festivities and be with our Sto Nino, the Holy infant Jesus! As the year ends, may we be able to continue our church mission – which is to be a Witness of Mercy… May this Year of Mercy expands to all of us and be merciful as our Sto Nino is merciful! May He continue to guide and bless us for always.

Pit Senyor and Viva Senyor Sto Nino!

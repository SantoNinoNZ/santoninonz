The Sinulog NZ 2014 Festival Queen candidates had fun at the Auckland Domain last Sunday, 24th of November. The girls had their photos taken by photographer Joey de Guzman.

They were photographed in their formal wear and another taken of them in their Sunday's best. The girls chose the clothes that they believed best reflected their unique personalities.

It was a great time for the girls to bond like sisters and shone their brightest.

Meet Ena Fiel, Jamie Denise Gear, Joanne Mijares-Supelana, Lilian Rose Martirez, Tara Gomez and Queenie Jose

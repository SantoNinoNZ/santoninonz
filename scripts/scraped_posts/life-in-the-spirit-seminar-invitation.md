To ALL ardent devotees of Senor Santo Nino,

If you have not been to a Life in the Spirit, come and learn about.

If you have been to one, come, be refreshed and learn more about it.

I promise you that you will never regret setting aside the weekend.

We have invited a team of very gifted speakers from the Philippines.

Let us not let this opportunity pass by. Let us know more about the gifts of the Holy Spirit that we received in Baptism and Confirmation  
And how we can make it work better in our life when building a personal relationship with Jesus, our beloved Santo Nino.

Receive the Power of the Holy Spirit!!!!!!!!!!! Alleluia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

God bless us all

Tito Oscar and Tita Miriam

Thank you for this blessed opportunity to be part of 2020-2021 Sinulog NZ Fiesta Celebration. As an outgoing North Shore Hermano and Hermana we would like to thank all our fellow Santo Nino devotees and families for welcoming the image of Santo Nino in your home. May Senyor Santo Nino hear all your prayers and petitons in your novena.

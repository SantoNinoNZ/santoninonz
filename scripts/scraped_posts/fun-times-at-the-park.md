THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN!!!! Sto Nino Devotees Groups, Voice of God Family Choir, Friends, Families and Supporters for making our End-Of- Year 2017 and Christmas in the Park gathering an overwhelming success and a very enjoyable one. Thank you to everyone who brought food and gifts. Thank you Cherry C. Thelmo-Fernandez for organising the games.  
Thank you all who prayed for the gathering.

As the year draws to a close, we praise and thank God for His powerful presence at every step of our way this year.

By His grace, may we continue to keep close to Him and to All the people He has brought into our life. God bless us All.

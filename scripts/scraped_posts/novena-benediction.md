O salutaris hostia,

Quae coeli pandis ostium,

Bella premunt hostilia,

Da robur; fer auxilium.

\*\*\*

Uni trinoque Domino

Sit sempiterna gloria.

Qui vitam sine termino

Nobis donet in patria. ~ Amen.

**Prayer to Santo Niño**

O Senor Santo Nino, you are our king and our God, we worship you. You are our strong defender, we turn to you. You are the patron of Cebu, the Philippines and the world, we come to you; You have made extraordinary wonders through your miraculous image in those chosen islands, remember us. Look down at this poor soul that comes to you for help. Lead us with Your wisdom; discipline us with your truth; console us with your tenderness, protect us with your might. We consecrate today our thoughts of you, only with you shall they be occupied; our words, only of you shall they speak; our sufferings, that we may endure them for your sake. We beg you Senor Santo Nino, illumine our understanding, kindle our will, cleanse our body, sanctify our soul. We wish what you wish, because you wish, as you wish, as long as you wish. Grant us, Senor Santo Nino, that we may feel love toward you, be strict toward ourselves be zealous toward our fellowmen, and rightly despise the things of the world. Help us to overcome sensuality with strict discipline, avariciousness with generosity, anger with gentleness, indolence with zealous industry. Make us wise in counsel, courageous in danger, patient in adversity, humble in prosperity. Teach us, dear Santo Nino, how worthless is the world, how sublime is heaven, how brief is time, how long is eternity. Grant us, lastly, that we may remember you, adore you, love you and serve you here on earth that we may be happy with you forever and ever in heaven. Amen

**SING: (Standing)**

Holy God, we praise Thy Name. Lord of all! we bow before Thee; All on earth Thy scepter claim, All in heaven above adore Thee; Infinite Thy vast domain, Everlasting is Thy reign. Hark! the loud celestial hymn, Angels' choirs above are raising; Cherubim and Seraphim In unceasing chorus praising, Fill the heavens with sweet accord, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord! Fill the heavens with sweet accord, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord!

_Recite three times Our Father, Hail Mary and Glory be to the Father in honor of Santo Niño._

**Ask Señor Santo Niño the favor you want to obtain in this Novena**.

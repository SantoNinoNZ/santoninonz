Dear Oscar and Miriam,

I was delighted to read the New Year Honours list in the _Herald_  and see your names among those recognised by the nation as deserving of an award. Congratulations to you both! I have long thanked God for your generous, wise and faith-filled leadership, and your loving service of the Church, especially among the Filipino people. It is very fitting that our state recognises your wonderful contribution to society. Praise God that your lives shine forth with the Lord, in your beautiful humble and loving ways!

God bless – especially as a new year opens!

David Tonks

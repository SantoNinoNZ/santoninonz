We are very thankful for being a part of the 2017 Sinulog NZ Fiesta Celebration. The experience has definitely made Sto. Nino closer to our hearts, gain us new friends and gave us the opportunity to serve Him in our own little ways.

The devotion from our fellow devotees are really outstanding. As a new year begins, may He continually shower us with his Blessings and Mercy, and keep us all inspired to keep our devotion and service to Him and to the Community. Viva Pit Senior!

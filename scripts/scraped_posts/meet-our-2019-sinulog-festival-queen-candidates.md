We are excited to introduce to our 2019 Sinulog Festival Queen candidates for 2019.

#1 Harliquine Malinao

Mabuhay! My name is Harliquine Geraldez Malinao. I am 20 years old and am proud to say I was born and raised in Arpili, Balamban, the Queen City of South Cebu. I am currently working as a retail manager, however, my dream is to become an early childhood teacher. I enjoy trying new things and I’m always ready for a spontaneous adventure!

My idea of a perfect day would be spending time at the beach with family and friends. I’ve always appreciated forming new friendships and I believe that it is important to be both confident and to feel beautiful, but more important to have a kind heart.

It would be a huge honour if I were to become Sinulog Festival Queen, and it would be a good opportunity to become a role model for other young women by teaching them the importance of being confident and feeling beautiful. It would be an honour to represent the lovely West Auckland!

Viva Pit Senyor kanatung tanan.

#2 Jessa Mae Garinganao

Kia Ora! My name is Jessa Mae Garinganao 25 years old from the “City of Smiles” Bacolod. My hobbies include singing and a little bit of dancing. Im adventurous and I love it when something is challenging that is why I decided to join the Sinulog Queen Festival for I know that I will be challenged to show the best of me when it comes to expressing how thankful I am for everything that the Almighty God has bestowed upon me.

For me, Sinulog Queen Festival embodies all the remarkable and unique things about Senior Sto Niño. It is such a great privilege and honour to dance for the Sto Niño and compete as one of the Sinulog Queen candidates for 2019. I do believe that this competition is not just about the crown its about being yourself, never to be afraid to show your true colours for I know that in the eyes of God we are all beautiful like a rainbow.

Mabuhay! Viva Senior Sto Niño!

#3 Melanie Maelzer

My name is Melanie Maelzer, born and raised in NZ. My mother is Filipino and my father is of European German descent. I have been living in Melbourne, Australia the last 5 years, working in the fashion retail space for one of Australia's favourite department stores – Myer, as a Content Marketing Specialist.

My decision to move back home was to be closer to family. One of my fondest memories growing up was participating in the Sinulog festival to dance, it was a great event to look forward to every year and connect to my mother's culture.

It is such an honour to dance and embrace Señor Santo Niño and I'm really excited to be a part of the 25th year celebration of Sinulog. It's amazing to see the history of Sinulog celebrated through such a glorious occasion.

Viva Señor Santo Niño!

#4 Christelle Quilang

Kia ora! Kumusta! I am Christelle Quilang, 19 years old, born in Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines and I have lived in New Zealand for 10 years. I study Psychology and Philosophy at the University of Auckland, through which I am also an athlete of its Cheerleading Association and an ambassador of Effective Altruism Auckland. I spend the rest of my time with family and friends and taking care of my 2 year old niece. I am an NZ blood donor and I have previously worked part time for 3 years and volunteered at a rest home. My highest aspirations in life are being the best caregiver and godparent to my niece and becoming a medical doctor.

I am grateful and excited for this opportunity to express my faith and to reconnect with my Filipino culture through this Sinulog Festival.

Senior Santo Niño has a special connection to my family.

Eleven years ago, my mother, my sister and I were in Cebu for our pre-departure orientation seminar. After which we visited Santo Niño Basilica to ask for protection for our journey to New Zealand and to give thanks for finally reuniting with my father and for this life-changing opportunity.

In 2013, my family was meant to tour my two grandmothers around Cebu, however the passenger ship they were on had an engine trouble and was drifting at sea. Santo Niño Basilica provided us with a venue to pray for their safety and to ease our worries. Our prayers were answered, they were rescued and sent back home safely.

Indeed, our faith is an anchor that makes us secure and hopeful in times of trials and storms in life.

Viva Señor Santo Niño!

#5 Ruella Ruzzell Jetaine Domingo Jambaro

Kia Ora!  
I am Ruella Ruzzell Jetaine Domingo Jambaro, for short RJ, 24 years of age. The youngest among tres marias daughters of Mr and Mrs. Ruel Jambaro Jr. Born and raised in the Philippines particularly from the sunshine city of Laoag and molded in the home of the Great leaders, Batac City, Province of Ilocos Norte. Honored to be raised by a God fearing family. Loves to dance, sing and serve. A Graduate of Bachelor of Science in Business Administration Major in Tourism Management in the Philippines and Diploma in Business here in NZ.  
Service runs in our blood. Having a grand father who was a lawyer, parents who are both in the Government services and siblings who serves other people as human engineers and life savers. Wrapped with these services that our family have is the best thing that we can offer and that is our service to God and to mankind as the instrument of goodness, generousity and love. Our family have been very helpful in serving God, the church, other people back home. Being a part of the Provincial Government of Ilocos Norte under Tourism Department was a great opportunity for me for I was given the chance to dance with the replica of Apo Sto Niño when Father Jonas Mejares brought it to Ilocos Norte. I was so blessed and it made me feel releaved from all the toils and travails of life that challenged me. After the replica of Apo Sto. Niño visit, a life changing event came when I was offered a job at Philippine Airlines but it didn’t last for long for when I was about to start my journey, my grand mother was diagnosed with sepsis and it made me feel bad and loose hope. When she passed away peacefully, I went back to Sto. Niño to ask his blessing and as if there was a feeling of electrifying goose bumps that made me stand and move on with my life. For I firmly believed that this is what my grandma would like me to do. To succeed, live life to the fullest. As promised, after my schooling in the Philippines and I bravely work-study again here in NZ at an early age of 20.  
I lived a life of my own for almost 5 years here in North shore,NZ. I am currently working as Assistant Manager and acting as Manager at Farro Fresh is one great opportunity for me where I was able to meet different cultures from their different walks of life and meet my extended families, St. John Paul II Catholic Community Albany family who has been the source of my strength in my faith and considered my second family as well. When I entered the portals of New Zealand, packed with me are the virtues that my family taught me that made me stronger. Stronger by faith and stronger by serving other people. For being alone during those times wasn’t easy for a young person like me but when I found myself in the church of St John Paul II Catholic Community Albany and with the guidance of our beloved Sto Niño. I was renewed, steadfast and strong.  
With no regrets of coming here in NZ and with the blessing of our Creator and powerful prayers. I am so blessed to be given the chance to join my first international pageant, the 2019 Sinulog Queen Festival, for I may not be from the land of Cebu but I know that by faith we are all even in the eyes of the church. This prestigious event will surely bless everybody who enjoins this festivity to uplift the faith and renewed faith in Him. I hope and pray that this event will hand in hand help others that we may not be born in the same place but by faith we are all brothers and sisters in Christ. Let peace and harmony live in our hearts and in hearts of many. Thank you for giving me this chance not just to serve the people but to praise and serve God. Again, This is Ruella Ruzzell Jetaine Domingo Jambaro. A faithful servant of God. Viva Pit Senyor! Viva Viva Viva!!
